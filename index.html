    <h2> Virtual Cabaret</h2>
      <p> Come join us for a virtual cabaret, <strong>April 23, 2021 from 7:00 pm to 8:30pm.</strong> Megan will be singing and playing some songs she's been working on with her voice teacher--the lovely Kate Merryman at Musicologie! <break>(<u>Note</u>: most of the songs Megan will be singing are clean. There are a couple songs that use explicit language, and one song that contains some adult references. Those two songs are: What Baking Can Do from Waitress, and I'm Breaking Down from Falsettos.) </break></p>

    <h2> Community Night</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest things missing from life during COVID is the chance to sing, dance, and sweat with other people. We still can't quite do that but, we can come together in other ways. <break>
      
      In order to engage as a community, we invite you to:</break> <ul><li> <strong>Make some art!</strong>
        
        <li>knit, paint, draw, crochet, or otherwise create arts and crafts while you are listening to the cabaret. We will try to save your eyes from Zoom fatigue! </li> 
        
        <li>We'll have a break during the show for people to share their artistic creations with the group if they like.</li> 
        
        <li> <strong>Chat!</strong> ,<li>participate by answering questions we'll be asking throughout the evening in the chat. 
          <li>For example, if you could make a t-shirt to describe your life philosophy, what would it say?</li> 

          <li> <strong> Serve a community </strong>
            <li>donate to the Homeless Families Foundation! </li>
            <li>We will set a goal for donations and see if we can hit it together. We'll check in on the donations throughout the evening.</li>
            
            <li>join us in singing as part of a song circle finale. Don't worry, you will stay muted. We'll be learning and singing a bit of the song One Small Voice. Yes, it's a song from Sesame Street. But that doesn't mean it's not awesome.</li></ul> </p>

    <h1>We hope to see you there!</h1>
